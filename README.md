# Sublime Oracle

Syntax highlighting for Oracle SQL and PL/SQL.

## Installation

Sublime Oracle can be installed via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). You can also `git clone` this repository into your packages directory. If you do, rename it "Oracle".

## Features

- Supports Oracle-specific constructs like `pivot` clauses, quoted identifiers, and factored subqueries.
- Detailed meta scopes for scripting and for the Expand Selection to Scope command.
- Factored subqueries appear in the symbol list.

## Current Limitations

- Not all Oracle constructs are implemented.
- No syntax-specific autocomplete.
- Does not run scripts.
